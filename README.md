# Population Modeling and Mental Health Prediction: Replication Paper Code and Results 

This repository aggregates the code and results data for the forthcoming paper:

"Population modeling with machine learning can enhance measures of mental health - Open-Data Replication" (2022). Ty Easley, Ruiqi Chen, Kayla Hannon, Rosie Dutt, Janine Bijsterbosch.


## Data Sharing and Privacy

This study was conducted with publicly-available data from the UK Biobank (UKB) 20k release. Only prediction output data is aggregated in this repository: no individual-specific inputs or subject ID numbers are included. 


## Results Data and Code Replication

Results can be replicated using the code in the "prediction" directory on UKB data; usage examples are available in "prediction/scripts." Prediction outputs for all data are given in "prediction/outputs."

Minimal functions for this paper's data manipulations (biotyping, task residuals, and phenotype averaging) are included in "manipulations."

Prediction outputs are included to allow for the re-plotting and examination of figures. See "figures" directory for more details and instructions on running figure-generating code.
